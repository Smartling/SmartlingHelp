Smartling offers several ways to give your Translation Resources information: For project-level information, use your [Style Guide](/hc/en-us/articles/201427556) and [Glossary](/hc/en-us/articles/201676763). For information that affects a particular file, Smartling letâ€™s you attach your instructions directly to the file itself:

**To add a File Instruction:**

**1)** From **Content>Files**, choose a file and select **Add File Instruction.**

**2)** Either type your instruction in the text box or upload a file. [Markdown-format links](/hc/en-us/articles/216722378) are supported. The file can be of any type, for example, an image file to aid Indesign translation, a Word document, spreadsheet, etc.

The instruction will be attached to every string extracted from the file. Translation resources will be able to read the instruction or download the file from the Translation Interface or in the List View.

**To edit or remove a file instruction:**

**1)** From **Content>Files**, choose a file and select **Add File Instruction.**

** **2)** **Either edit the text and click **Save.** Or click **Remove Instruction**.
