**Step 1 - Turn on Assignment**

From **Project Settings** > **Translation Workflow**,edit the Workflow step you want to assign content for and enable Content Assignment.

**Step 2 - Filter unassigned content**

Under **Content>Translations**, set your filter to **In Progress** for strings **Pending Assignment**.


**Step 3 - Assign content to a translation resource**

**1)** Select the string/s to assign and select **Assign Resources.** To assign all content in a workflow step, [filter for that workflow step](/hc/en-us/articles/203416736) and select **Assign All.** This will assign all content in the workflow step to a maximum of 5000 strings.


**2)** Enter the number of words to assign each translation resource and click **Check Availability**.


**3)** Click **Assign** and Smartling automatically assigns the strings to the translation resources, who are notified by email.

**Step 4 - Search for content assigned to a translation resource**

From the **In Progress** view, select a language, and from the search box drop down select the translation resource.


**Step 5 - Un-assign content assigned to a translation resource**

Check strings to unassign and, from the **Actions** menu, select **Unassign.** You can also unassign all content in a workflow step by [filtering for that workflow step](/hc/en-us/articles/203416736) and selecting **Unassign All**.


**Note:** You can not unassign content for which a translation resource has already submitted a translation.
