**1. Use the Workflow summary view**

![](/uploads/versions/checkstatus---x----2560-1408x---.png)The [Workflow summary view](/hc/en-us/articles/203574006-The-Summary-Screen-Account-Owners-and-Project-Managers) gives you a global view of your content and quickly lets you know where your content is at by language, workflow and workflow step. Now just click on a number to access the content under that step and language.

**2. Jobs**

![](/uploads/versions/checkstatus2---x----2551-1322x---.png)With [jobs you can organize and prioritize your content](/hc/en-us/articles/202670453-Jobs-Organize-and-Prioritize-Translations) independently from languages, workflows, and workflow steps.Once you've added content to a job, you can then use the Job page to check on its status. You can add content to a job while authorizing content for translation, or at anytime while the content is still in progress.

**3. Search and Filter**

![](/uploads/versions/checkstatus3---x----2552-1359x---.png)From the In progress view use the [Search and filter options](/hc/en-us/articles/203416806-Search-and-Filter-Agency-Account-Owners-and-Translation-Resource-Managers) located a the top of the page to check on the status of a very specific string and group of strings.
