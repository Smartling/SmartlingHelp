If you use browser automation software - such as Selenium, PhantomJS - for testing purposes, you can set up the Chrome Context Capture Extension to integrate with your existing test scripts and take a snapshot and any point in a script.

**To use the Chrome Context Capture Extension with browser automation:**

**(1)** In **Chrome>Preferences>Extensions,** find the Chrome Context Capture Extension, and click **Options**.

**(2)** Check **Detect Automation**.

**(3)** To take a snapshot during automation, add this code to your script.
```
d
```

<span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">**Override Existing Context**</span>

By default the Chrome Context Capture Extension will not override existing context, but this behavior can be customized by using yourÂ automation script to apply Smartling HTML classes to a page or to specific elements in the DOM.

**To override context for an entire page:**

Add the two classes "sl-override-context sl-translate" to the page's HTML tag.

**To override context for specific elements on the page:**

**(1)** Add the "sl-notranslate" class to the HTML tag of the page.

**(2)** Add the two classes "sl-override-context sl-translate" to the elements you want to override context for. Any nested child elements will also be overwritten.
