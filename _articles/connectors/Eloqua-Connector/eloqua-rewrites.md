The Eloqua connector's Rewrite Rules feature helps to more quickly localize content like URLs, phone numbers etc that cannot be translated in the standard translation interface.

To begin, find the "Rewrite Rules" tab under the Eloqua section of your Eloqua project. Click the "Create" button and enter the exact text you would like to replace.

Under the replacements section, enter whatever you would like the rewrite to be in the appropriate language and press the Save button.

The rewrite will be applied across all emails you translate from Eloqua. For example if you have an English email address help@mycompany.com and would like to use hilfen@mycompany.com for all of your German translations, you only need to create one rewrite rule, and it will be applied whenever the connector sees "help@mycompany.com".
