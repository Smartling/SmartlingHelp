Smartling's Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector helps you to quickly and easily translate email content in Smartling. You can download original content from Salesforce Marketing Cloud for translation in Smartling. Completed content is automatically exported back to SMC. Or translations can be exported manually at any stage.

## Translate Content

1) In your Smartling project, navigate to SF Marketing Cloud

2) Smartling supports assets created in Content Builder or Emails, you can toggle between the two using tabs in the top right of the page. Make sure you're in the correct section.

3) Check the items you want translated, and click Request Translation.
