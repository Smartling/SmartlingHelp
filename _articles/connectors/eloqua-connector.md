Smartling’s Eloqua Connector lets you use Smartling’s Global Fluency Platform to translate your content, including Emails, Landing Pages and Dynamic Content. Once the Connector is set up, you can download your original content from Eloqua for translation in Smartling. Completed content is automatically exported to Eloqua, or translations at any stage can be exported manually.

## Setup the Connector

**1)** Set up a Connector-type project and ask your Smartling Success Manager to turn on the Eloqua connector for the project.

**2)** Log into the project, navigate to&nbsp;**Eloqua &gt; Translate Content** and click&nbsp;**Login to Eloqua**.

**3)**&nbsp;You will be taken to the Eloqua login page to authorize Smartling to access your account.

<div class="info">While it is not required, it's a good idea to create a new Eloqua user for the Connector to use. That way, content added by the Connector won't be confused with that created by a regular user and the Connector will continue to function if any of your Eloqua users are disabled.</div>

**4)** Navigate to&nbsp;**Project Settings &gt; Eloqua Settings** and set up your preferences for resubmitting translated content. If you select&nbsp;**Auto**, once you request translation for a piece of content, any further changes you make to the source content in Eloqua will be automatically uploaded to Smartling for translation.

Your selected items will be authorized into the default workflow for each language.

## Monitor translation progress

To check on the translation progress for an asset, like an email, click anywhere on the row showing information about the asset, this will show its details.

Additionally, status information is displayed next to an asset in the main view. There are 3 possible states:

1) Translation complete for all requested languages (blue checkmark)

2) Translation in progress (orange arrows)

3) Some kind of error (red warning sign)
