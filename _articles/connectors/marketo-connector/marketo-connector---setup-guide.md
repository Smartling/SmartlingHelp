## Setup a Marketo API Role

Smartling uses Marketoâ€™s API to import your emails to the Smartling Dashboard and return translated emails to the Marketo Dashboard.

Your Smartling CSM will then be able to enable the Marketo Connector for your Smartling project.

To do this, follow the steps in the Quickstart Guide for [Marketo REST API](http://developers.marketo.com/blog/quick-start-guide-for-marketo-rest-api/). When you configure permissions for the API role, you only need to grant **Access API &gt; Read-Write Assets**.
