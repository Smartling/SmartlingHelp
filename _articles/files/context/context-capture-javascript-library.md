Smartlingâ€™s Context Capture Library is a javascript library, which can be embedded in a web page to automatically send HTML snapshots of the current page state to a Smartling Project.

The library sends contextual information to Smartling when a page is browsed, so make sure you embed the library in an environment that is used. The library has been calibrated to minimize any impact on page performance.

This project is currently in beta. You will need a unique orgId to upload context for your project. This is available from any Smartling Project at Project Settings &gt; API.
