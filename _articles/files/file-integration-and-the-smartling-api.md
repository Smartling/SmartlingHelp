The Smartling API is a REST-like API that allows you to access functionality provided by the Smartling Translation Management Platform using defined [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) requests and structured [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json) responses. Full specs for integrating files and using the Smartling API can be found at [docs.smartling.com](http://docs.smartling.com).
