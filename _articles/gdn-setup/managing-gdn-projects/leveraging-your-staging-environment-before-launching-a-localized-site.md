If you already use a staging environment for your website or application, you can also take advantage of it in Smartling. The staging environment enables you to manage your translation flow on staging like you would in production, with a few added benefits.

**1. Simultaneously publish new content and its translation**

Capture new source content to staging before you publish it to production; the source content gets to the translator faster and can then be translated by the time you publish it on your production site. Smartling will recognize identical content between the staging and production sites and will apply the translations automatically to the content on production. You can then publish both the source content and localized content simultaneously, avoiding source content bleed onto your localized sites.

**2. Using staging to QA localized content**

Once your content is translated and published on staging you can start optimizing the layout, test your content swaps and translations rules instead of having to do this in your production environment.

**3. Easy domain set-up in Smartling**

To set-up your staging environment in Smartling, go to the dashboardâ€™s domain management page add your domain and select staging as the environment type. In order for Smartling to be able to proxy the staging site be sure to update your DNS entries accordingly.
