## Subdomains

When you set up your localized sites on subdomains, the translated domain is part of a larger domain; for example, es.domain.com or fr.domain.com. 
On the pro side, a subdomain is easy to set up, allows for easy failover configuration, and offers a clear separation of sites. On the con side it is not the most SEO friendly set up: content under ccTLDs and subfolders tends to be better ranked by search engines.
