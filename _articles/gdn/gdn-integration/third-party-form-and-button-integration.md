title: Third-Party Form and Button Integration
---


Embedded forms and buttons are natively translatable in the GDN. However, externally hosted forms and buttons - from third-party providers such as Hubspot, Marketo, Eloqua, or Pardot - require extra integration to allow them to be translated.

There are two ways to approach hosted form integration. If you have only one or two forms for a small number of languages, it may be easiest to create a different form for each language and use [content swaps](/knowledge-base/articles/creating-localized-content/) to set the correct form for each language.

If you have multiple hosted forms translated into many languages, however, you need to allow Smartling to capture and translate the hosted form directly. This will require a Smartling administrator, so contact your Client Services Manager for help translating hosted forms or buttons.
