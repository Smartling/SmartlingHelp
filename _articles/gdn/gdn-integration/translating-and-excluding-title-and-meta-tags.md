title: Translating and excluding title and meta tags
---

Text appearing within the `<title>` tags of a page, or in `<meta>` keywords and description tags, will always be translated, by default. 

These tags can be excluded from translation with the `notranslate` attribute, like:  

~~~html
<title notranslate>Booking a room</title>
~~~
