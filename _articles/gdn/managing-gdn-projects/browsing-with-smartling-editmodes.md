When you browse a translated site, you will see `smartling_editmode=1` in your browser's address bar. By changing the value of `smartling_editmode`, you can switch to one of four edit modes.

## `smartling_editmode=1`

This mode shows the most recent saved translations and includes the Translation Interface editing tools. Content owners can authorize content into the default workflow from this view.


## `smartling_editmode=2`

This mode excludes the translation tools but still includes the latest saved translations. This mode is useful for browsing content that has been translated but has not yet reached your published site, for example, content which is being reviewed.

## `smartling_editmode=3`

This is a 'debugging' mode, showing the status of each string, rewritten links, etc.


## `smartling_editmode=4`

This mode shows only the source language, but still captures content as you browse. You may find this mode easiest to use when trying to capture new content on a half-translated site.
