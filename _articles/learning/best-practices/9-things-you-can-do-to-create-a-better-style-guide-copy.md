**1. Provide as much background information as you can about your site or organization**: The better a translator understands who you are where you come from, where you are going, and how you are getting there, the better they can interpret your message. Also don’t just copy and paste your “About” page. Get your entire team involved in telling the story!

**2. Take the time to explain what you do**: You know what you do but not everyone else does. Explain it simply so that your translation team can also explain it in a foreign language.

**3. Know your audience**: Narrow down the group or audience you are addressing: Is it made up of busy execs? Are they a 20-something social app users? Describe your typical audience to your translation team so that they can use the most appropriate tone of voice for their translations.

**4. Research your target market:**&nbsp;Before you list your linguistic conventions, do your research. You might be surprised to find out that certain countries’ linguistic conventions are drastically different from yours.

**5. Don’t limit yourself to one style guide:**&nbsp;Smartling lets you have as many style guides as you want, so go wild! Don’t do it just because you can, but because from one language to another, conventions, like tone, use of formal language, etc. might not be the same.

**6. List your references:&nbsp;**For certain languages make sure your translation teams know which reference material to follow. Such as certain dictionary, technical or industry-sanctioned lexicon, etc.

**7. Be specific:**&nbsp;The more detailed you are about the specifics of your translations the better the translation. You can add instructions for just about everything from how you want dates, addresses, abbreviations to be translated to the length of the translation.

**8. Update your style guide:&nbsp;**A style guide does not need to be a static document. On the contrary! Update it every time your company introduces changes to its own messaging.

**9. Be patient**: Just because a Translation Resource Team doesn’t get it right the first time doesn’t mean that your style guide was not useful or that the team is not good. Finding out what content translators are struggling with might actually uncover inconsistencies in your own tone and messaging.
