For the best and easiest way to manage everything that goes into a translation project, Smartling’s Enterprise Translation Platform lets you “package” your linguistic assets together: glossaries, style guides, translation memories, and leverages. Once everything is packaged, you can assign all those settings to one or more projects with a few clicks.

Now the remaining question is: how many Linguistic Packages should you have? We don’t have any exact numbers for you. Instead we’ve listed a few considerations that’ll guide you to your magic number.

## Less is better

The idea behind linguistic packages is a centralized and simplified way of managing linguistic assets. As tempting as it is to have one package per project, it would be come down to managing assets at the project level all over again. Instead consider merging your packages so that you have less to deal with.

Let your different content types dictate the number of linguistic packages

Let’s say you have 4 types of translation projects: mobile apps, marketing websites, marketing collaterals, and support content sites.

Although you’d assume that the content in each project is similar enough to only warrant 1, maybe 2 packages, you should consider a few more packages.

A mobile project might need a different style guide than a support documentation project. A support project could use a larger glossary than a marketing website. And The marketing website needs a different leverage configuration than the mobile site…

## Sometimes, one package is all you need

Again, the idea behind packages is to simplify assets management. If you’ve organized your project not around content type but other variables, I.e Agency assignment or file type, but your content remains similar then you might need just one linguistic package. And that’s just fine. Build a single package, and apply it to all current and future projects. Voila!

## What about no Linguistic packages at all?

Your account will always have at least one Linguistic Package. Remember that a well-built package or suite of packages can make a lot of differences in the quality, speed, and cost of your translation.
