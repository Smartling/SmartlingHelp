Smartling allows you to create a new glossary from an imported Excel file (.xlsx). This is helpful if you want to edit a lot of terms at once, or if you have a legacy glossary that is formatted in a similar way to a Smartling glossary. Correct Formatting of the imported file is essential to a successful import. See Glossary Spreadsheet Format for details.

**1)** From **Assets** &gt; **Glossaries**, click **Import Glossary**.

**2)** Name your new glossary, select your Source Language, choose an Excel file to upload and click **Import Glossary**.

**3)** The upload process may take a few minutes. You can switch to your new glossary by clicking the **Gear Wheel** and selecting your new glossary from the dropdown.
