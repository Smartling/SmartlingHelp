A style guide is a collection of rules about your preferences for content formatting and writing tone, and style that you want translators to follow so that your users and customers have a consistent experience across all languages. The style guide explains punctuation, spelling, formatting, adaptations, and language-specific preferences or errors to avoid, and helps translators and editors ensure that translations are accurate and consistent.

## Create a New Style Guide

**3a)** If you choose to work from a Smartling Template, respond to as
<br>many of the questions as you can. No fields are required, but the more information you give translators, the more valuable your style guide will be.

**3b)** If you chose a custom style guide, write your style guide in the edit window. The editor provides basic formatting options. When you are ready, click&lt; **Save Changes**.

## Assign a Style Guide to a Project

Style guides are assigned to a project as part of a Linguistic Package. See [Create and Manage Linguistic Packages](/knowledge-base/articles/create-and-manage-linguistic-packages/) for more information.
