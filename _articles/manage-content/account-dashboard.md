The Account Dashboard is the home for all your Smartling projects.

Access the Account Dashboard by clicking the **Smartling** logo.

## Watch Content

Use the new **Watch** feature to mark any group of content you want to keep an eye on. You can watch a whole project, a workflow or a single workflow step - either for a chosen language or for all languages. Click the **Eye** anywhere content appears in the dashboard to add content to your watch list.

From the Account Dashboard, click any of your watched items to navigate straight to your content. [Find out more about watching](/support/articles/watching-content/).

## Manage your Projects

The new Account Dashboard gives you a list view of projects instead of cards to let you manage any number of projects easily. From the same screen you can:

* Filter and search to find the project you’re looking for
* Clone any project or create a brand new one
* Rename or archive your projects
* View and interact with issues for each project.
* See counts for words and strings in progress for each project.

### Labels

When you have a lot of projects it can be hard to keep them organized. That’s why we’ve added the ability to label projects for better organization.
