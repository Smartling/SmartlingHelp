Before content is translated, you must Authorize it. You can find unauthorized content at **Content&gt;Translations** by setting the stage filter to **Awaiting Authorization**. Smartling gives you two ways to authorize content: default and custom.

## Default authorization

To authorize strings for all languages in a project and send strings to the default workflow for each language, click **Authorize** for an individual string, and **Authorize Group** to authorize all strings in a URL or file.

## Custom Authorize

To authorize strings on a per-language basis or specify a workflow for those strings:

**(1)** Use the checkboxes to select the strings that you want to authorize, or set your filter to a single workflow step if you want to authorize all strings in that step.

**(2)** From the Actions menu, select **Authorize for Translation** to authorize selected strings only or&nbsp;**Authorize All** to authorize all content matching the current filter.

**(3)** In the Authorize dialog box, select your languages, the Workflow for each language and a [job](){: .cc-active}, if desired. Click **Submit**.

## Partially Authorized Content

The Awaiting Authorization List View can be configured to show partially authorized strings - that is, they have been authorized for one or more languages, but not for all languages in the project. To show these strings, check **Show Partially Authorized**.
