Issues are a way for users working on a translation workflow to communicate with other users about the original source content and translations. For example, a Translator might create an Issue to ask a question about terminology in a particular string. By using Issues, you can record any communication about a string, and this can be seen by anyone working on it. Issues streamline the translation workflow. Translators get answers to their questions about the original content so they can translate it quickly and correctly. &nbsp;Translation resources can review and provide feedback about translations collaboratively. Issues can be created, commented on and resolved.

[Markdown-format links](/knowledge-base/faq/adding-links-to-translator-instructions-or-issues/) are supported in issue text.

> The processes below are for managing Issues from the List View. The same functionality is also accessible from the **Issues** tab of the Translation Interface.

## Issue Categories

There are two kinds of issues: **Source String issues** and **Translation issues**. The kind of issue you create will affect who sees the issue in the dashboard and receives notifications about it. Each string can support multiple issues.

### Source String

Issues or questions about the original content, such as clarification about the meaning of the original string or a mistake/typo. Source string issues are not language specific and will be visible to all users with access to the string in any language. By default, Account Owners and Project Managers will receive notification about Source String issues if they have enabled notifications. &nbsp;The Translation Resource who opens the Source String Issue and any other who comments on it will receive notifications about comments and state change.

### Translation

Issues dealing with the translation of the string for a particular language. Translation issues will be visible to Account Owners, Project Managers, and Translation Resources working in the same language.

### Subtypes

Each category of issue has subtypes, giving a little more information on what the issue is about. Subtypes are:

| Source            |  Translation |
| --------          |--------------|
Review Translation  | Clarification
Doesn’t Fit Space   | Misspelling
Placeholder Issues  |
Poor Translations   |

### Permissions and Notifications

Different types of users have different levels of access to issues:

| &nbsp; | **Source String Issues** | **Translation Issues** |
| **Account Owner** | Can see, comment and close. Receives notifications for all issues. | Can see, comment and close. Receives notifications if they opened or commented on the issue. |
| **Project Manager** | Can see, comment and close. Receives notifications for all issues. | Can see, comment and close. Receives notifications if they opened or commented on the issue. |
| **Translation Resource/ Translation Resource Manager** | Can see, comment and close.

## Tips for managing Issues

* Account Owners and Project Managers should respond to Source String Issues as fast as possible. &nbsp;When translators open source string issues there is a good chance they are not able to proceed with translation or don’t feel confident in creating a translation because they need resolution of their question. Having a source string issue is also a strong indication that there might be a problem with how the string was captured. For example, placeholders might be incorrect. &nbsp;It’s possible the string shouldn’t be translated at all or needs to be recaptured with updated integration.
* At any time, Account Owners and Project Managers can view and manage all open issues for all their projects from the [Account Dashboard](/knowledge-base/articles/account-dashboard/).
* Anyone can close an issue, but it is often good practice to let the person who opened an issue close it, to make sure they are satisfied with the resolution.
* You can manage your e-mail notification preferences from the Project Notifications tab of your Smartling Profile
* Account Owners and Project Managers can keep track of issues in the [Issues Report](/knowledge-base/articles/issues-report/){: .cc-active}.
* We recommend that issues get resolved before the translation is published. We allow content to be published with open issues because most users don’t want to hold up their translation workflow, however, it’s good practice to resolve all issues so that the reports will accurately reflect your project’s current state. If needed you can return translations for editing after they are published in order to address the issue. Alternatively, you can opt to use Smartling's [pre-publishing](/blog/tips/reduce-time-to-market-with-pre-publish/) functionality, so you can begin serving translations immediately, but wait to resolve all issues before they are published.
