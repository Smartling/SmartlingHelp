Once your content is part of a project,you can manage your content from the List View at **Content &gt; Translations**.

**(1)** From the list view, use the [Search and Filter](/knowledge-base/articles/search-and-filter-in-the-list-view/) options to find the strings you wish to manage and either:

**(a)** Select the individual strings you want to manage.

**OR**

**(b)** To perform an action on all strings matching your current filter settings, leave all strings unchecked.

**(2)** From the **Actions** menu, select the action you want to apply. The actions available will be different depending on project type and whether you have selected individual strings.

## Possible actions

### Add/Remove Tags

* Add a tag to strings. You can [filter](/knowledge-base/articles/search-and-filter-in-the-list-view/#filter-by-string-properties) the list view by tags to locate these strings later.


### Add Translator Instruction

* Add instructions for the translator on a per-string basis.
* Instructions will be displayed to the Translator both in the In Progress and Translation Interface view.


### Add to / Remove from Job

* Add strings to an existing [Job](/knowledge-base/articles/jobs/#add-or-remove-translations-from-a-job) or create a new Job.
* To remove strings from a Job, [filter](/knowledge-base/articles/search-and-filter-in-the-list-view/#filter-by-string-properties) the list view for that Job and select the strings you wish to remove.


### Assign/ Assign All

* [Assign](/knowledge-base/articles/assign-content-to-a-translation-resource/) a Translation Resource to the selected string.
* Assign All will select all strings matching the current filter. To unlock this option you must set the [List View filter](/knowledge-base/articles/search-and-filter-in-the-list-view/#filter-by-workflow/step) to show results for a single workflow step.


### Authorize for Translation

* Move strings from the **Awaiting Translation** queue to **In Progress** and add to your chosen Languages and Workflows.
* [See Authorize Content from the List View](/knowledge-base/articles/authorize-content-from-the-list-view/).


### Authorize All

* Authorize all strings in the current filter for all language and add to your chosen Languages and Workflows
* [See Authorize Content from the List View.](/knowledge-base/articles/authorize-content-from-the-list-view/)


### Clear Authorization Queue

* Delete all strings with a status of Awaiting Authorization.


### Create Pattern

* Use selected strings to [define a pattern](/knowledge-base/articles/create-and-manage-patterns-gdn/).


### Delete String (GDN projects only)

* Delete the source content.
* The string will not appear in translated websites.


### Exclude from Translation

* Move selected strings from **Awaiting Authorization** to **Excluded Content**.
* Although strings are not displayed to the translator, the strings are published in their original form.


### Fuzzy Estimate / Fuzzy Estimate All

* Create a [Fuzzy Match Estimate](/knowledge-base/articles/fuzzy-match-estimates/#create-a-fuzzy-estimate-from-the-list-view), either for selected strings, or all strings in the current filter.


### Move/Move all

* [Move strings](/knowledge-base/articles/move-strings-between-workflow-steps/) from one Workflow step to another.


### Pre-Publish

* Pre-publish strings that are In Progress, but are not yet complete. Pre-published strings appear on your translated GDN site and are considered 'Published' when [downloading translated files](/knowledge-base/articles/download-files/), but still proceed through the editing workflow as normal. Pre-publishing is useful if you want to get provisional translations live as soon as possible but leave the option to edit them later before you finalize the translation.


### Publish

* Publish selected strings. Translations will be ready to be downloaded in a file project, or viewed on a translated site in a GDN project.


### Reactivate String

* For [inactive strings](/knowledge-base/articles/inactive-strings/) only - reactivate the string so it can be edited and published.


### Reset Context (Files project only)

* Disassociate strings from their context.
* Translators will see the string in the Smartling non-contextual view.


### Return Content

* Return strings to the previous Workflow step.

### Set Maximum Length

* Set a [character limit](/knowledge-base/articles/set-a-character-limit-for-a-translation/) for translations of selected strings.


### Submit to Next Step

* Submit strings to the next Workflow step.


### Unauthorize

* Returns authorized strings to the Awaiting Authorization queue. See [Unauthorize Content](/knowledge-base/articles/authorize-content-from-the-list-view/#unauthorize-content) for more information.


### Unassign / Unassign all

* Remove any Translation Resource assignment from the selected strings.
* Unassign All will select all strings matching the current filter.
