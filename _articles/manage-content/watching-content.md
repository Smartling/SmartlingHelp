The new Watching feature allows you to mark content you want to pay close attention to. There are three levels of content you can watch:

* A whole project
* A workflow
* A single workflow step


Within each level, you can choose to watch all languages or a specified language. You can mark up to 100 items of content to watch in the dashboard by clicking the **eye** icon:

* From the Project Summary Screen:

* From the Workflow Summary Screen:


![](/uploads/versions/watchingcontent2---x----2550-1020x---.png)

* From the Account Dashboard:


![](/uploads/versions/watchingcontent3---x----1293-1042x---.png)

Watched content is displayed in the **Watching** section of the account dashboard. From here you can:

* Click the name of any item to navigate to the content.
* View a status message for the content, including actions required, such as content requiring authorization or assignment.
* View and manage open issues relating to the content.
* See counts for strings and words in progress.
* Toggle watching by clicking the **eye**.
