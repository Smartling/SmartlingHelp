Users for a Smartling account are managed from the **Team** page. The users you see, and the workflow assignments you can make will depend on your user permissions within the account.

You can click an **active user** to edit their profile, add a user, search for users by name, email address, or role, and click an **invited user** to re-send an email invitation. You can also filter your list of users by name, status, and the workflow steps and languages they are assigned to.

You can manage Agencies in the same way as managing individual users, by switching to the Agency tab. If you assign an Agency to a Workflow step, the Agency Owner or Translation Resource Manager can then assign work in that step to Agency translators. To add a new Agency relationship to your account, contact your Smartling Customer Service Manager.
