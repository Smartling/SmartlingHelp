title: Set Up A Default Role For New Users
---

Account Owners can configure their Smartling account to allow anyone with an email address in a company domain (e.g. username@mycompany.com) to set up a Smartling profile, instead of having to invite each user individually. To do this you need to set up a default role and set of projects for new users to have access to.

**1)** Contact your Smartling administrator to make sure this feature is enabled for your account.

**2)** In any Smartling project under your account, navigate to **Project Settings > Sign In Settings** and switch to the **New User Management**

**3)** Check **Allow any domain users to login to Smarting.**

**4)** Add your email domain to the Domains list. You can add up to five domains.

**5)** Add the projects you want new users to have access to under **Default Projects**

**6)** Set the Default User Role. You can choose either Requester or Project Manager.

**7)** Click **Save**

Anyone with an email address in your chosen domains can now use the **New User Registration URL** to create a Smartling profile with your chosen default role and projects.
