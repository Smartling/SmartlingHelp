Smartling Account Owners,  Project Managers, Agency Account Owners, and Translation Resource Managers are able to add users and manage user access.

## User Roles and Responsibilities

When you set up a new user, you give them access to a limited number of features defined by their role:

* **Account Owner** -  Manages the translation process from capture to delivery including settings  and users, across all projects under the account.
* **Project Manager** -  Manages the translation process from capture to delivery within a particular project including settings and users.
* **Agency Account Owner**  Assigns content for translation and monitors progress until delivery.
* **Translation Resource Manager** -  Assigns Translation Resources to workflows and steps to which they have access. A Translation Resource Manager (TRM) may be part of the client's project team or an translation agency. Agency TRMs can manage only Translation Resources from their agency.
* **Translation Resource** - Translates, edits or rejects, or reviews assigned content.
* **Requester** (if enabled) - Uploads, downloads and monitors jobs for translation from a limited view of the Smartling dashboard. The Requester Portal must be enabled by your Smartling CSM. More detail is available in our Requester Portal documentation. 

## User Status
* **Pending** Smartling allows you to recruit your user community to participate in the translation of your content.  The Custom Dashboard feature is used to create a publicly available user registration page. Users who fill out your registration from from the custom dashboard will appear on the People page as "Pending".  In order to accept their registration you must give them specific workflow assignments at which point they become "Active".
* **Invited**  When you add a user to your account their status is "Invited".  After they complete their profile by following the link in the email they received, they will become "Active".
