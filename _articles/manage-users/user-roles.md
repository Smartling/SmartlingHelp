Smartling Account Owners,  Project Managers, Agency Account Owners, and Translation Resource Managers are able to add users and manage user access.

## User Roles and Responsibilities

When you set up a new user, you give them access to a limited number of features defined by their role:

* **Account Owner** -  Manages the translation process from capture to delivery including settings  and users, across all projects under the account.
* **Project Manager** -  Manages the translation process from capture to delivery within a particular project including settings and users.
* **Agency Account Owner**  Assigns content for translation and monitors progress until delivery.
* **Translation Resource Manager** -  Assigns Translation Resources to workflows and steps to which they have access. A Translation Resource Manager (TRM) may be part of the client's project team or an translation agency. Agency TRMs can manage only Translation Resources from their agency.
* **Translation Resource** - Translates, edits or rejects, or reviews assigned content.
* **Requester** (if enabled) - Uploads, downloads and monitors jobs for translation from a limited view of the Smartling dashboard. The Requester Portal must be enabled by your Smartling CSM. More detail is available in our Requester Portal documentation. 

See our [User Permissions](/knowledge-base/articles/user-permissions/) matrix for a complete list of permissions for each user type.
