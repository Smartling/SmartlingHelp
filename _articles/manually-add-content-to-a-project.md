Account owners and project managers can manually add content for translation.  

###To manually add strings: 

**1)**  Go to **Content>****Translations** and select **Awaiting Authorization.**
**2)**  Click **Add String.

**3)** Type your string then click **Add**. You can include HTML tags to your strings, as well as add strings that match an existing pattern (for example, `Hello {1+chars}`) or specify placeholders (for example, `Hello {0}`).

**4)**  The string appears under **Awaiting Authorization**. You can search for the string by entering keywords or by setting your URL filter to 'strings'.
