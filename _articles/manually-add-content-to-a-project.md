**3)** Type your string then click **Add**. You can include HTML tags to your strings, as well as add strings that match an existing pattern (for example, `Hello {1+chars}`) or specify placeholders (for example, `Hello {0}`).

**4)** The string appears under **Awaiting Authorization**. You can search for the string by entering keywords or by setting your URL filter to 'strings'.
