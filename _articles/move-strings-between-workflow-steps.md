Account Owners and Project Managers can move translated strings from one Workflow step to another from the List View.

**1)** Select all strings you wish to move and from the **Actions** menu, choose **Move Strings**.

**OR**

From the **Actions** menu, select **Move All**. This will move ALL strings that fit your current filter settings, even if there are too many to display in the List View. Depending on the number of strings, it may take a few minutes to complete the move.

**2)** Select languages, workflow and workflow step. The language you are currently viewing in the List View will be selected automatically. If you select additional languages, your choice of workflows will be limited to workflows available for all of your selected languages. Click&nbsp;**Submit**.
