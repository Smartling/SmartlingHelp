Account Owners and Project Managers can move translated strings from one Workflow step to another from the List View.

**(1)** Find one of the strings you wish to move and click the step name to filter that Workflow step. You must set the Workflow step filter before you can move strings.![](/uploads/versions/moveworklow---x----1133-189x---.png)

**(2)** Select all strings you wish to move and from the **Actions** menu, choose **Move Strings**.

OR

From the **Actions** menu, select **Move All**. This will move ALL strings that fit your current filter settings, even if there are too many to display in the List View. Depending on the number of strings, it may take a few minutes to complete the move.

**(3)** Select the Workflow and step to move the strings to. If you are moving strings because of an issue, you can also type text to create an issue for each string you are moving.
