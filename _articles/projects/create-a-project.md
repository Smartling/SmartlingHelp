* **Web &gt; Global Delivery Network** - Capture and deliver web content through the Smartling [Global Delivery Network](){: .cc-active} without uploading files.
* **Web &gt; CMS Connector** - Integrate directly with your site's CMS using a [Smartling Connector](){: .cc-active}.
* **Business Documents** - Translate Microsoft Office documents or Adobe InDesign files.


**(3)** Enter your project name and select the source and target languages. The target language list will be pre-populated with all locales used in any projects on your account. Smartling [highlights](){: .cc-active} some popular languages with a star and provides additional information.

* Project Name
* Website URL (if available)
* Linguistic Package - A package of translation assets to use for this project. See [Create and Manage Linguistic Packages](){: .cc-active} for details. If you don't want to use an existing Linguistic Package, you can create a new one.
