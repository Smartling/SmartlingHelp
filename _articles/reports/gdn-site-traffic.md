Smartling offers high-level, downloadable Site Traffic Report compiling requests for each one of the locales set-up in your project.
{: .present-before-paste}

Only calls to HTML or XML content are considered requests, excluding redirects, or other formats such as images, .pdf, videos, etc. Ajax requests will be counted as well assuming they return HTML or XML content types.

Note: This report counts the number of times Smartling serves requests for GDN sites. It does not count human page views and bot traffic is not removed.&nbsp;
