The Processed Words Report records the daily number of words translated for the first time in a project, either via a person or machine Translation. An [account-level version](/knowledge-base/articles/account-level-reports/) is also available.

Words translated via SmartMatch are not included. Fuzzy match scores do not affect the count.

Imported translations and words submitted from a revision step are not counted in the Processed Words report.

To run the report, select Languages and a date range and click **Filter**.
