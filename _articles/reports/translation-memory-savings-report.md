title: Translation Memory Savings Report
---


This report allows the user to quantify (in USD) cumulative cost savings resulting from translation memory, since launching with Smartling.

Dollar TM Savings are calculated by applying the total (translation+ edit) "enterprise base rates" for Smartmatched content (excluding ICE matches), and Translation-only enterprise base rates for all other tiers of fuzzy matches to total cumulative content over the lifetime of a customer. While this report can be filtered to any specific date range, it always displays lifetime savings till the end date, regardless of the start date of the report.
