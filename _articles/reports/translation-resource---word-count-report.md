As a translator or editor you can generate word count reports.

To generate a word count report, Browse toÂ **Reports &gt; Words Counts**, select a date range and click **Get Report**.

The Word Count report provides you with a report on the number of translations submitted by translators or editors. Translation Resources only have access to their own reports.
