title: Translation Velocity Report
---


The Translation Velocity report allows you to track how fast your strings in your project are being translated. An [account-level version](/knowledge-base/articles/account-level-reports/) of this report is also available.

For a selected period of time, the report gives you the average time in hours between:

* strings being authorized and a translation being submitted;
* strings being authorized and being published (excluding weekends); and
* strings being authorized and being published.


To run the report, select Languages and a date range and click **Filter**.
