The Translation Velocity report allows you to track how fast your strings in your project are being translated. An [account-level version](/hc/en-us/articles/216811267) of this report is also available.

For a selected period of time, the report gives you the average time in hours between:

*   strings being authorized and a translation being submitted;
*   strings being authorized and being published (excluding weekends); and
*   strings being authorized and being published.

To run the report, select Languages and a date range and click **Filter**.
