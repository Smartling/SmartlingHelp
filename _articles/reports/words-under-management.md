title: Words Under Management
---


Account Owners and Project Managers can access a report that displays the total words under management for your account in addition to a breakdown by project/locale. This allows you to quickly understand the impact of adding a locale to a project.

Access the report by choosing&nbsp;**Words Under Management**&nbsp;from the&nbsp;**Reports**&nbsp;dropdown, anywhere in the dashboard.

The report displays the total approved words under management, as well as approved words by project and locale.

The Words Under Management report is updated daily, so it may take some time before changes in your project are reflected in the report.
