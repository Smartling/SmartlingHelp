Account Owners and Project Managers can authorize, edit or reject jobs submitted by Requesters. Depending on your Requester Portal settings, jobs submitted by requesters may need to be authorized by an Account Owner or Project Manager.

**To manage jobs:**



**(1)** From **Content>Jobs**, select **View Details** from the dropdown on a Job card to check the details of the job.

**(2)** To make changes to the job before authorizing, click **Edit Details.**

**(3)** To reject the job, click **Reject**. Enter a reason for rejection. The Requester will receive an email notice that the job has been rejected.

**(4)** To authorize the job for translation, click **Authorize.** Select a workflow for each language and click **Confirm**.
