The Requester Portal must be enabled by Smartling before it can be accessed by an account. Contact your Smartling Client Services representative and ask for Requester Portal to be enabled.

**To create a Requester:**

**(1)** Follow the steps in [Add a User](/hc/en-us/articles/201016167#Add).

**(2)** Select **Requester** as the user role.

**To set authorization preferences:**

**(1)** From **Content&gt;Jobs**, click the **Gear** icon.

**(2)** If you want Requesters to be able to authorize their own jobs for translation, check **Requesters authorize jobs for translation**. If the box is unchecked, jobs submitted by Requesters need to be authorized by a Project Manager or Account Owner.
