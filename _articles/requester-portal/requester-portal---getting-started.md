The Requester Portal must be enabled by Smartling before it can be accessed by an account. Contact your Smartling Client Services representative and ask for Requester Portal to be enabled.

## Create a Requester

**1)** Follow the steps in [Add a User](/knowledge-base/articles/add-and-manage-users-and-agencies/#add-a-user).

**2)** Select **Requester** as the user role.

## Set authorization preferences

**1)** From **Content&gt;Jobs**, click the **Gear** icon.

**2)** If you want Requesters to be able to authorize their own jobs for translation, check **Requesters authorize jobs for translation**. If the box is unchecked, jobs submitted by Requesters need to be authorized by a Project Manager or Account Owner.
