A user with the Project Manager, Account Owner, or Requester role can upload files into a job and submit that job for translation. Depending on the preferences set by the Account Owner, a Requester may be able to authorize jobs for translation, or may need to submit them for review by a Project Manager or Account Owner.

## Create a job

**(1)** From **Content &gt; Jobs**, click **Add Job.**
