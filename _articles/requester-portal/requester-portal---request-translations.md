A user with the Project Manager, Account Owner, or Requester role can upload files into a job and submit that job for translation. Depending on the preferences set by the Account Owner, a Requester may be able to authorize jobs for translation, or may need to submit them for review by a Project Manager or Account Owner.

## Create a job

**(1)** From **Content > Jobs**, click **Add Job.**

**(2)** Give the job a name, due date and description. Select your target languages.

**(3)** Upload the files you want translated by clicking **Upload File** and browsing to the files’ location. **Note:** Files jobs cannot be edited once they are created so check that all files and languages are correct.

**(4)** Click **Create**.
