This article Applies to Smartling Free and Pro plans

The Smartling platform allows you to translate from any source language to any target language.

Customers in our Free and Pro plans can purchase translations from our trusted partners. &nbsp;Not all language pairs are available for purchase. &nbsp;If a language pair you have added to your project is not available for purchase you will see the message "Not Available" in the Purchase Translations dialog.

You can still translate using Smartling, but you will need to find your own translation resources and give them access as translators to your account.
