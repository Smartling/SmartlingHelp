Smartling accounts using a self-service plan have the ability to order pre-paid professional translations.

Your account may have a translation credit balance for professional translation services. &nbsp;When purchasing professional translation services, any credit available will be used first to complete the order. &nbsp;Any remaining balance required to complete the order will be charged to the credit card on file for the Smartling account.

When purchasing translations there is a minimum card charge of $10.00 USD. &nbsp;If the order is less than $10.00 then the difference will be an account translation credit balance, which will be available for your next order. You are debited only for your actual translation costs.
