Smartling allows you to impose a character limit on a stringâ€™s translation. Setting a character limit prevents Translation Resources from saving a longer translation.

You can set character limits from the List View or from the Translation Interface

****From the List View:****

**1)** Mouseover the string you want to limit and click the **T**icon.  

**OR**

Select any number of strings from the list view and, from the **Actions** menu, click **Set Maximum Length**.

**2)** Enter a character limit and click **Submit**

**From the Translation Interface:**

**1)** In the **Code** tab, click **Set Limit**.

**2)** Enter a character limit for the string and click **Submit**.

**Note:** Character limits apply across all locales.
