You can check spelling of translations within the Smartling Translation Interface.

## To enable Smartling spell check:

In the Settings dialog box, select **Smartling spellcheck enabled**.![](/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203650358/Smartling___Translations_Management.png)

With Smartling spell check enabled, when Smartling detects a misspelled translation, it underlines the term in red.

Clicking the term displays a list of spelling suggestions.

If you prefer to use your browser's built-in spell checking feature, just keep the Smartling custom spell checking deselected.
