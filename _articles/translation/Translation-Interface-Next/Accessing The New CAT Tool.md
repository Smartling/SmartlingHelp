## How do I access Smartlingâ€™s new CAT tool?

There are 2 main ways in which you can begin translating on the New CAT Tool

First, in the list View on the Smartling Dashboard, you can select Add Translation or Edit Translation from a specific string, or select Add or Edit translation in the dropdown on the right

Doing so launches the New CAT Tool for all strings in the current list view, that are also in the same workflow step as the selected string. This is because the New CAT Tool adapts and gives you different translation tools, based on whether you are translating, reviewing or proofreading content.

<br>If your current list view filter contains strings in multiple workflow steps, you will first be asked to confirm that you want to select content in the same workflow step as your current string, or be asked to select another workflow step you'd like to filter by.

On hitting Continue, the New CAT Tool loads with the selected strings, and highlights your selected string ready for translation

As a translator or agency owner, you can also launch TI Next from your Jobs dashboard. You can do so by either clicking on the Job name in a Job card: This takes you to the list view with the filtered list of strings and workflow steps you are authorized for the current job. Or, you can select a command from the "Available for Work" panel at the bottom, that loads list view with all content in the current workflow step that you are authorized for. From here, loading the New CAT Tool works the same as before.

## How can I go back to the classic CAT tool if I do not like the new CAT tool?

The switch from the Classic CAT Tool to the New CAT Tool is an account level action. In order to request a switch back to the Classic CAT Tool, please get in touch with the account owner.

## What happens to my translations if I go back from the new CAT tool to classic CAT tool?

If you have saved translations in the New CAT Tool, you may experience some loss of translation memory and error messages if the account is switched back to the Classic CAT Tool. This is due to the new flexibility introduced in tag-handling; reverting back to the Classic CAT Tool will result in some segments getting unmapped, translations being defaulted to the first segment in a string, and loss of segment-level translation memory for such strings.

## Why am I not able to access the new CAT tool?

The switch to the New CAT Tool is an account level action. It is possible that you are able to access the new tool on certain customer accounts, but not on others, depending on whether the account has been rolled over. On trying to load the New CAT Tool, you may see the following message:
