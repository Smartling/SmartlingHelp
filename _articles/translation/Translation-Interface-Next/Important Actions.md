## How do I Save a translation in the New CAT Tool? What happens when I Save translations?

As a translator, Saving your translations makes them available in the customer’s translation memory for others to see and reference. You should save your translations as soon as you believe they are close-to-final and ready to be seen by others.

You can either Save your translation individually by choosing to save multiple translations simultaneously by using the global Save button, or you can save strings one at a time, by using the string-level Save action.

<br>&nbsp;

Note that Saving translations still keeps them available to you to change at a later time, if needed. However, you do not receive credit for your translations, till you have Submitted them.

No Saving is required in the Edit/ Review step, as translations are already saved. Strings that are changed in the Edit/ Review step are saved as part of the Confirm command.

## What happens if I haven’t saved my translations and I lose internet connectivity?

With the new Draft Mode, the New CAT Tool automatically backs up translations in the local browser, as you type it, where it remains available even if you lose connectivity or close your browser until the time you are ready to save. It is important to note that draft translations cannot be retained if browsing privately, or if a user clears out her browser cache.

## How do I Submit my translations? What happens when I Submit translations?

Submitting a translation finalizes your translation and moves it to the next step in the workflow. At this point, your translations are locked, and you can no longer modify them.

You can choose to either Submit only your saved translations that you have already finalized, or you can choose to submit all your translations. With this option, all your translations are first saved, and them submitted to the next step in one go.

## As an editor/ reviewer, how do I Confirm a translation? What happens when I Confirm translations?

As Editors and Reviewers, In stead of needing to Save translation, Editors and Reviewers can Confirm a translation- this allows an editor to mark which translations they have already checked to be accurate, or to save updates to any translations they have changed. &nbsp; &nbsp;

## As an editor/ reviewer, how do I Reject a translation? What happens when I Reject translations?

The Editor can choose to Reject a translation, or a set of translations. Rejecting a translation moves it to an earlier step in the translation workflow. In doing so, the editor must provide feedback on why the translation is being rejected by filling out a short form.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;insert 11_Reject video&gt;

The Editor can also also choose to Reject all unsubmitted translations using the global Reject command. Doing so rejects all unsubmitted strings back to an earlier workflow step, and attaches the reject comments as an issue to all the rejected strings.

## Why am I unable to save/ submit my translations?

Depending on a user’s account settings, translations with certain quality errors in them are prevented from saving, till these errors are corrected. Save/ Submit errors are shown in a message box as follows:

![](/uploads/versions/screen-shot-2017-03-06-at-11-54-59-am---x----499-399x---.png)
<br>&nbsp;

In this example, one or more segments in a string are empty. The user can choose to ignore this error, and continue saving. For other errors, the user must fix the translation error, or she is unable to save her translation.

The decision of which errors should prevent a user from saving or submitting translations are made at the account level.

## Why am I unable to change a translation in the New CAT Tool?

Translations can no longer be changed, once they move to another step in the workflow than the one the user is currently accessing the New CAT Tool for. This may happen because the user herself submitted a translation, following which a “Lock” icon appears on the submitted translations.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;insert 12_Submit Lock video&gt;

<br>Alternatively, another user who may be authorized to translate the same content may Submit translations, thereby locking these for the user to change or Submit herself.
