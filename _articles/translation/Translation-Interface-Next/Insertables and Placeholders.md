## What are placeholders and insertables?

**Placeholde*r***: In the Smartling dashboard, **placeholders** are used to mark parts of a string that do not need to be translated. The content contained within the placeholder will usually be populated dynamically in the application. In Smartling,** placeholders** are always represented by a number or a set of characters highlighted in grey and/or contained within curly brackets.

***Insertable***: An **insertable** is a formatting marker. Such as, a non-breaking space (**NBSP**) or line break (**BR**).

## How are insertables displayed in the new CAT tool?

**Insertables&nbsp;**will be displayed as clickable light grey bubbles within the source.&nbsp;
