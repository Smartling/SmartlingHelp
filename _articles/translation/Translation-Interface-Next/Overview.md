## Why are you changing the current CAT tool?

To build the best CAT tool on the market, we realized we’d have to renew our commitment to helping users achieve their goals. As a result, we focused our design process exclusively around three key results:

## What’s new in the CAT tool experience?

1. &nbsp;**More context with the new multi-string editor:** Translators no longer have to work on one string at a time, and can now translate and submit multiple strings at the same time with greater speed and accuracy.

1. **Faster translations with keyboard shortcuts:**We have introduced the most robust and customizable keyboard shortcut library to translators. With shortcuts for every major command, the New CAT Tool also allows translators to “Bring their own shortcuts”, letting them customize the New CAT Tool to mimic the shortcuts of their favorite offline CAT too.

1. **New tag-handling experience:**Perhaps the biggest change in the New CAT Tool is the new tag-handling experience. Tags are pieces of code that ensure that your translations render correctly on your website, document, mobile app or video. Our customers desire greater flexibility in how to manage the tags, and not be restricted to making tags identical in the source and target. To do so, we’ve introduced a new experience for translators to be able to easily work with tags in the New CAT Tool.

1. **“Draft” auto-save for translations:**While working in the browser, translators may lose their work if they lose connectivity or close their browser by accident. To prevent this, we’ve introduced a new “Draft Mode” that automatically backs up your content in your local browser, as you type it, where it remains available even if you lose connectivity or close your browser until the time you are ready to save. It is important to note that draft translations cannot be retained if browsing privately, or if a user clears out her browser cache.

1. **Translation Quality Checks:**The New CAT Tool introduces a new “quality check” tool that identifies the most common translation errors and categorizes them for the user, allowing for an easy, intuitive interface for managing translation quality prior to submitting content.
