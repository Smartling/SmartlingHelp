## What are quality checks?

Smartling automatically detects several categories of mechanical translation errors, each of which are mapped by default to a certain level of severity. At the moment, the following five quality checks are supported in the New CAT Tool:

* **Spelling error:**A word is misspelled in the target language (Low severity)
* **Leading/ trailing space error:** There is an extra space at the beginning/ end of a segment (Low severity)
* **Double-space error:**There is a double-space in the middle of a segment (Low severity)
* **Missing placeholder:**A placeholder in the source is missing in the target (Medium severity)
* **Missing tags:** A tag in the source is missing in the target, or an extra tag is inserted in the target, or there are extra spaces around tags, or the tag order doesnâ€™t match with the source (High severity)

In the months ahead, another thirty quality checks will be added to the New CAT Tool.

## How do I run quality checks on my translations?

Some quality errors are errors shown in the editor. In the video below, you can see a spelling error, a double-space error, and a leading and trailing space error. Strings with translation errors are shown with a red triangle next to them.

To run a quality check on all translations currently on your screen, use the QA check button, which creates a report of all errors detected in your translations.You can then filter by specific error categories, click into a specific error, and fix it. The report updates itself in real time. Once you are certain that you have fixed all quality errors, you are ready to Submit your translations.
