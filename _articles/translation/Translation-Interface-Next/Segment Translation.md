title: Segment Translation

## What are segments, and how are they displayed in the new CAT tool?
Can not change order of segments in the new CAT tool 
Merge segments: little diagonal arrows on the top bar ( you can revert too) 
Blue bar shows segments in a string 

## Why do I see an error when I save a segment?
Need to complete all the segments in the string. 

## How do I see translation memory matches in a segment?
String and segment level matches will be shown 
(see Kunal doc on string level matches)

Documentation for segment level matching: https://docs.google.com/a/smartling.com/document/d/1dvPnGLHgzTU7J-IjgluoylKNcbQktIlBIMb1DQN3f8A/edit?usp=sharing
