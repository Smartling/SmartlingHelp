## What happened to code view?
No more code view. Tags in editor. Reason: a lot of translators say it is helpful. Allows more flexibility around which tags they want to use. 

## How are tags displayed in TI Next?
Grey highlighted. “Simple View” (visually easier to focus on text) vs. “Expanded” (code view).  “Toggle Tags”: how you change settings (gif)

## How do I insert or remove tags in TI Next?
Command i (keyboard) > keep clicking rapidly and it will cycled (gif)
Tags are always added and removed in pairs to preserve code. Ordering can still be changed.
