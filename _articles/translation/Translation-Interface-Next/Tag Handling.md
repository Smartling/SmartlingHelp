## What happened to code view?

The code view in Smartling’s classic CAT tool has been upgraded to a new integrated view. All of the code, tags, and markup will now be available for the user directly in the editor.

## How are tags displayed in the new CAT tool?

The tags are signified by grey highlighting. The translators are given an option to toggle between a simple view (visually easier to focus on text) and expanded view. This simple view conceals the code as a [placeholder](/knowledge-base/articles/Insertables-and-Placeholders/) allowing the user to focus on the text. The expanded view shows all of the code within the editor.

To switch between the expanded and simplified view, simply click on the toggle tags (&lt;/&gt;) on the toolbar or utilize the [keyboard shortcut] (/knowledge-base/articles/Keyboard-Shortcuts/).

## How do I insert or remove tags in the new CAT tool?

Tags are always added and removed in pairs to preserve code.

By using the "Insert Next Tag"**&nbsp;**shortcut on your keyboard and continuing to click rapidly, you can cycle through all of the tag options present in the source string.

“Auto Complete”: Begin typing and a tag suggestion will appear. Push **enter** to auto complete.

Lastly, you can also use a keyboard shortcut to copy over all tags from the source into the target. The keyboard shortcut for this can be found as an option under the command for copy source into target command in the editor toolbar.
