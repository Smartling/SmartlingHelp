## What happened to code view?

The code view in Smartling's classic CAT tool has been upgraded to a new intergrated veiw. All of the code, tags, and markup will now be avaible for the user directly in the editor.

## How are tags displayed in the new CAT tool?

The tags are signified by grey highlighting. The translators are given an option to toggle between a simple view (visually easier to focus on text) and expanded view. This simple view conceals the code as a [placeholder](/knowledge-base/articles/Insertables-and-Placeholders/) allowing the user to focus on the text. The expanded view shows all of the code within the editor. 

To switch between the expanded and simplified view, simply click on the toggle tags (</>) on the toolbar or utilize the [keyboard shortcut] (/knowledge-base/articles/Keyboard-Shortcuts/).

## How do I insert or remove tags in the new CAT tool ?

Command i (keyboard) &gt; keep clicking rapidly and it will cycled (gif) Tags are always added and removed in pairs to preserve code. Ordering can still be changed.

“Auto Complete”: Start typing tag suggestion will pop. Push enter to auto complete.
