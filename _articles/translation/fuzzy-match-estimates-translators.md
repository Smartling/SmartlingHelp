Fuzzy Match Estimates compare all available untranslated content in your translation queue against the project's Translation Memory and return the number of words in each match range according to the Fuzzy Match Profile set by the content owner.

Fuzzy match scores may affect how you are paid for translation.

**1)** Go to **Content &gt; Fuzzy Estimates**.

**2)** Click **Create New Estimate**.

The estimate may take a few minutes to generate. Past estimates are kept in the dashboard for 60 days.
