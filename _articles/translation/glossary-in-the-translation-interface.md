The Glossary helps translators to provide correct and consistent translations of key brand terms. Glossary terms are highlighted for translators in the Translation Interface (TI).

## Access the Glossary from the TI

There are two ways to access the Glossary from inside the TI:

* Click a bracketed term to view/edit the details of a term
* Click **Glossary** to search the whole glossary.

## Editing a term

If the Account Owner has permitted Translation Resources to edit Glossary terms you will be able to edit the Part of Speech, Definition, Translation, and Translation Comment for the term.

> Note that changes you make to the Translation and Translation Comment will only affect the current language you are working on, but changes to the Part of Speech and Definition will affect all languages.
