*This article applies to Global Delivery Network, Application Resource File, Business Document, and CMS Connector project types.*

By default, Smartling does not allow you to manage leading or trailing spaces manually between target fields and, in a few cases and depending on the formatting, it creates unnecessary spaces.

Smartling does allow you to leave a target field empty, but warns you first.

**If you wish to manage spaces manually between target fields:**

1. In the **Translation Interface**, go to the **Code View** tab
2. Select **Manually manage spaces between translation fields** to add or delete leading spaces.
3. Use the code view to see where space appears and check that spacing is appropriate at the beginning and end of each field.

**Please note:**

* If you reorder a segment, the system automatically switches over to the manual space management.
* When you save a string for which you have enabled manual space management it cannot be undone the next time you edit the string.
