With the **Jobs** feature, Smartling enables Account Owners and Project Managers to group and prioritize content for translation: create a job, select the content for the job, and add a due date as needed.

As a Translator you have access to a list of jobs with due dates in the Summary View. Jobs are organized by earliest due dates. Click **Fuzzy Match Estimates** below any job to view a [Fuzzy Match Estimates report](/knowledge-base/articles/fuzzy-match-estimates-translators/) covering the strings for that job:

To access strings in translation for a particular job :

**(1)** Go to **Content&gt;Translations** and select **In Progress**.

**(2)** Select a Job using the Job filter. Please note that Jobs with no due-dates are displayed in the drop-down, along with jobs with due-dates.
