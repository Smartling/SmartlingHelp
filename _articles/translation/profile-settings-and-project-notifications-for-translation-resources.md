* **Content notifications:** help you keep track of content as it progresses through the different stages of translation.
* **Issues Notifications:** Get notified each time someone creates, answers or resolves an issue. By default, you are set-up to receive notifications for all types of issues.


**Note**: You can not currently manage notifications on a per-language basis. Notifications apply to all languages for which you have access.
