Smartling gives you finer control over how your translation and source text looks in the translation interface.

Note: These settings allow you to optimize your experience in the Translation Interface, but do not affect the way strings will appear in translated files or on the GDN.

In the Translation Interface, click **Settings &gt; Translation Settings** to access your options.
