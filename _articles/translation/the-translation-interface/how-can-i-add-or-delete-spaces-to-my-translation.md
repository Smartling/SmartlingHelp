By default, Smartling does not allow you to manage leading or trailing spaces manually between target fields. If necessary, you can enable manual space management.

**1)** In the **Translation Interface**, go to the **Code View** tab.

**2)** Select **Manually manage spaces between translation fields** to add or delete leading spaces.

**3)** Use the code view to see where space appears and check that spacing is appropriate at the beginning and end of each field.

**Please note:**

* If you reorder a segment, the system automatically switches over to the manual space management.
* When you save a string for which you have enabled manual space management it cannot be undone the next time you edit the string.
