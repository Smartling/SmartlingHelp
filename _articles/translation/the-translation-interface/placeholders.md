**What is a placeholder?** In the Smartling dashboard, placeholders are used to mark parts of a string that do not need to be translated. The content contained within the placeholder will usually be populated dynamically in the application. In Smartling, placeholders are always represented by a number or a set of characters highlighted in grey and/or contained within curly brackets.

To translate a string with a placeholder, you can either copy the placeholder from the original string or type it manually. Typing the characters of the placeholder in your translation field will automaticallycreate a placeholder.

Tocopy placeholders over to the target field:

**(1)** Place your cursor where you want to insert the placeholder

**(2)** Click on the placeholder in the source segment.

To remove a placeholder from a target field:

**(1)** Mouse over the placeholder

**(2)** click the **X** located in the upper right corner of the placeholder.

**Positional Information**

Smartling automatically adds numbering to all placeholders, representing their order in the source string, since translators sometimes need to alter the positioning of words in a sentence. If translating a string with more than one placeholder, be careful to place each one correctly in the translated string.
