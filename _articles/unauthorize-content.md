If you have authorized content for translation by mistake, Smartling allows Account Owners and Project Managers to unauthorize strings from the List View. Unauthorized strings are returned to the **Awaiting Authorization** queue. The unauthorize action is recorded in the string's history.

**Note:** Only strings without a translation can be unauthorized.

**To unauthorize strings:**

**(1)** From **Content>Translations**, select one or more strings and choose **Unauthorize** from the **Actions**menu.



**(2)** Select the languages you want to unauthorize and click **Submit.**
