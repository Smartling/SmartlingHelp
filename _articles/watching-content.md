The new Watching feature allows you to mark content you want to pay close attention to. There are three levels of content you can watch:

*   A whole project
*   A workflow
*   A single workflow step

Within each level, you can choose to watch all languages or a specified language. You can mark up to 100 items of content to watch in the dashboard by clicking the **eye** icon:

*   From the Project Summary Screen:  



*   From the Workflow Summary Screen:  



*   From the Account Dashboard:  



Watched content is displayed in the **Watching** section of the account dashboard. From here you can:

*   Click the name of any item to navigate to the content.
*   View a status message for the content, including actions required, such as content requiring authorization or assignment.
*   View and manage open issues relating to the content.
*   See counts for strings and words in progress.
*   Toggle watching by clicking the **eye**.
