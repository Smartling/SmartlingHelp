Even if you have been invited to be a Translation Resource on a Smartling project, you may not be able to see any content in the Dashboard. This might happen for several reasons, including

*   No content has yet been uploaded to your project by the Content Owner
*   The Content Owner may not have</span> [authorized](/hc/en-us/articles/201012778) any content for translation in your language. As a Translation Resource, you will only have access to strings available for you to translate. Unauthorized strings won’t be visible to you.
*   If your workflow step has (/hc/en-us/articles/203604913#Customize) enabled, you may only be able to see strings that have been specifically assigned to you.

**If you believe you should have content available for translation, contact the Content Owner.**
