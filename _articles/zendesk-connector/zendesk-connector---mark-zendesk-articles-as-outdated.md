The Zendesk Connector gives you two options for handling updated source content in an article you've already translated.

### Automatic

Smartling will automatically retrieve any changes in your source content for Zendesk for translation. To enable this option, from&nbsp;**Project Settings &gt; Zendesk Settings** set&nbsp;**Resubmit changed content** to&nbsp;**Auto**.

### Manual

If you set **Resubmit changed content** to&nbsp;**Manual**, you can use Zendesk's&nbsp;**Outdated** flag to mark changed source content.

Outdated articles are marked in the **Translate Content** screen with a checkmark in the Outdate column. If you want to capture the changed content, simply check the outdated articles and click&nbsp;**Request Translation** again.
