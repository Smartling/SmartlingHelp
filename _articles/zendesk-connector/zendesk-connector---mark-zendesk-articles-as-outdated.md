The Zendesk Connector gives you two options for handling updated source content in an article you've already translated.

###Automatic

Smartling will automatically retrieve any changes in your source content for Zendesk for translation. To enable this option, from **Project Settings > Zendesk Settings** set **Resubmit changed content** to **Auto**.

###Manual

If you set **Resubmit changed content** to **Manual**, you can use Zendesk's **Outdated** flag to mark changed source content.

Outdated articles are marked in the **Translate Content** screen with a checkmark in the Outdate column. If you want to capture the changed content, simply check the outdated articles and click **Request Translation** again.
