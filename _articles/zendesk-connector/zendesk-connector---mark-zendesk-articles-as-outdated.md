If you make changes to your source content, you should mark the article as outdated in Zendesk. This will allow you to view which translations are out of date in Smartling and request those articles for translation to capture the updates. In the Zendesk editing window, check the&nbsp;**Outdated**&nbsp;box.

Outdated articles are marked in the Request Translation screen with a checkmark in the Outdate column.

The&nbsp;**Outdated**&nbsp;flag has no effect on your source content inside Zendesk.
