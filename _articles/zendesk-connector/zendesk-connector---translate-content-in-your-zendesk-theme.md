Smartling uses the Zendesk API to retrieve Articles and Dynamic Content from your Zendesk account for translation. Text that is part of your Zendesk Theme is not directly available via the Zendesk API.

However, you can make your Theme content available for translation in Smartling by replacing text in your theme with Zendesk Dynamic Content.

See the [Zendesk documentation]() for more information about Dynamic Content.

## To Translate your Zendesk Theme text in Smartling:

**1)** Copy the text you want to localize from your Zendesk theme.

**2)** In your Zendesk Dashboard, create a new piece of Dynamic Content and paste in your theme text.

**3)** Replace the text in your Zendesk theme with your new Dynamic Content tag.
