##To request translation:

**(1)** From the Smartling Dashboard, navigate to **Zendesk > Translate Content**. You will see a list of all available articles in Zendesk, including the date each article was last modified. The list will include both translated and untranslated content.

**Note:** The list will include both draft and published content. You can request translations of draft content, but Context is only available for published content. We recommend marking articles that require translation with the [Outdated flag in Zendesk]().

**(2)** You can switch between Article, Section, Category and [Dynamic Content]() from the drop-down next to **Translate Article**.

**(3)** Select the items you want to translate and click **Request Translation** and choose your target languages.

**Note:** Image content will remain the same among all translated Zendesk articles and cannot be changed.

For knowledge base articles, the Connector will also generate context for translators - showing them a real-time preview of what their translations will look like in the knowledge base:

##Export Translations to Zendesk

Completed translations will be exported to Zendesk automatically. You can also push translations manually. If there is no translation for a string, the original string will be exported to Zendesk when done manually. You may wish to manually push untranslated source content to your translated Help Center sites while working on translations.

##To export translations manually:

From the Smartling Dashboard, navigate to **Zendesk > Translation Progress**. Select the articles you want to export back to Zendesk and click **Export to Zendesk**.
