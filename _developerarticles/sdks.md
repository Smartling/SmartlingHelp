Smartling provides Software Development Kits (SDKs) for interacting with the Smartling Translation API. The SDKs allow you to integrate the API with your build process without worrying about low-level API details. Smartling currently provides v2 SDKs for Java, PHP and Python.

The SDKs are fully open source. You are welcome to fork for your own needs, commit improvements, and request that changes integrate into the main branch.

Do you have a suggestion or question about the SDKs? Email us at [support@smartling.com](mailto:support@smartling.com).
