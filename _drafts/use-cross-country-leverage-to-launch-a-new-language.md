Back in May, Smartling introduced Linguistic Packages - a way to group up Style Guide, Glossary, Translation Memory, and Leverage and use all of those assets on a set of content. &nbsp;Linguistic Packages gave us some additional functionality we call Cross Locale Leveraging.

What is Cross Locale Leveraging?

Cross Locale Leveraging is the ability to use translations from one language as a translation for another language. &nbsp;For example, if you translate French for France and you want to use those translations for French in Canada, you can set up Cross Locale Leveraging to automatically populate French (Canada) with French (France) translations. &nbsp;Using SmartMatch settings, you can control whether the French (Canada) translations are Published automatically or sent to an Edit/Review step for further review and customization.

Why use Cross Locale Leveraging?

The primary benefit of Cross Locale Leveraging is to be able to translate into a variant of a language without having to complete an entire translation workflow. &nbsp;This speeds up time-to-market and reduces cost for launching a new language.

Common Cross Locale Configurations

Cross Locale Leveraging and be setup for any variant of a language. &nbsp;For example:

French (France) -&gt; French (Canada)

German (Germany) -&gt; German (Austria)

Portuguese (Brazil) -&gt; Portuguese (Portugal)

Spanish (Latin America) -&gt; Spanish (Mexico)

Etc.
