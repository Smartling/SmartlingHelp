Smartling supports markdown format for providing links in string instructions and issues. To add a link, use the following syntax:

~~~
[Link Text](http://www.link-url.com)
~~~

Note that there is no space between the brackets and parentheses. The URL can be a relative URL (you may want to use a relative URL to point the user somewhere in the Smartling Dashboard).

Note: If you use markdown format for at least one link in the issue or instruction, any other URLs not in markdown format will not be converted to clickable links.
