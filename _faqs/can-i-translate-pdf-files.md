It is not possible to directly support the translation of PDF files.

However, all PDFs are created from some other type of file, many of which we do support (IDML, Word, Powerpoint, etc). If you have access to this original file, upload and translate it, then create a new PDF from the translated file.

If you don't have the original file, you can try using Microsoft Word to convert the PDF file into a word document.late all new content and replace the machine
