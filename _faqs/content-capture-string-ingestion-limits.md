When you capture content for translation in Smartling, you may occasionally reach the limit of content that can be captured for your project:

## Global Delivery Network Projects

Smartling limits ingestion to **10,000 strings** to the authorization queue. Smartling imposes these limits to avoid overloading the dashboard with unmanageable amounts of content for translation.

## Files-Based Projects

Files projects do not have a limit of strings that can be ingested, but we do [limit the size of files that can be uploaded](/knowledge-base/articles/supported-file-types/#file-size-limits).
