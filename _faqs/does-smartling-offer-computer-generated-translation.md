Smartling does not provide it's own machine translation service, but it does provide two distinct ways of integrating third-party translation providers into a Smartling project:

* [Send content from a particular Workflow step to a machine translation service.](/)
* [Automatically machine translate all new content and replace the machine translation with human translations as they become available.](/)
