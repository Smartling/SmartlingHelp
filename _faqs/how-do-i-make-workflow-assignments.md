Smartling gives you two ways to make assignments, depending on whether you're focused on a particular user or on a piece of content.

## User-focused

*"I'm setting up a new translator with all their assignments"*

The easiest way to set up a new translator with all their assignments is from their entry in the team page. See [Manage Users and Agencies](/support/articles/add-and-manage-users-and-agencies/#add-a-user) for details.

## Content-focused

*"I'm setting up a new workflow and I want to add several resources"*

To assign several resources to the same workflow step, the simplest way is from the&nbsp;**Workflow Settings page**. Just click the dropdown in any step and select&nbsp;**Manage People.**&nbsp;
