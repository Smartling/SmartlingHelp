Compared to source strings in English, translated strings may differ in character length, typically by 30-50%.

The best way to handle this is to plan for translation in your design and make sure you have extra space for longer translations where needed. If you need the translator to conserve space you can set a character limit for translations from the List View.

Alternatively, you can try adding line breaks or adjusting CSS for the page.
