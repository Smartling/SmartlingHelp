If the context for a string is incorrect of misleading, you can reset its context to avoid confusion. Translators will see the string without any context.

## Reset context for specific strings

From the List View, select one or more strings, click the **Actions** menu, and select **Reset Context**.

## Remove Image Context Files

To remove an Image Context file entirely from the project - use the [Remove](/knowledge-base/articles/adding-image-context-for-mobile-and-desktop-application-files/#remove-image-context-files){: .cc-active} feature from the Context Files management screen. Smartling will reset context for all the strings associated with that Image.

## Override Context - Image Context:

Any time you associate a string with an Image file, any existing content will be overwritten automatically.
