If the context for a string is incorrect of misleading, you can reset its context to avoid confusion. Translators will see the string in the Smartling [non-contextual](){: .cc-active} view

### Reset context for specific strings

From the List View, select one or more strings, click the **Actions** menu, and select **Reset Context**.

### Remove Image Context Files

To remove an Image Context file entirely from the project - use the [Remove](){: .cc-active} feature from the Context Files management screen. Smartling will reset context for all the strings associated with that Image.

### Override Context - Image Context:

Any time you associate a string with an Image file, any existing content will be overwritten automatically.

### Override Context - Smartling Chrome Context Capture Extension

[See Override Context with the Chrome Context Capture Extension](){: .cc-active} for details.
