In Smartling, 'Leverage' generally describes two processes one is SmartMatch, the other is leverage in the Translation Interface and in Fuzzy Match Estimates.

[SmartMatch](/) automatically applies translations to strings you've translated before. SmartMatch only leverages existing translations if it finds a match for a whole string and only applies to 100% text matches.

After SmartMatch takes place, you can still get more leverage out of your existing translations. When a Translation Resource translates a string or segment in the Translation Interface, matches or near-matches from your existing translations are displayed to them. These matches are also used when calculating Fuzzy Match estimates. For these purposes, Smartling looks for matching segments, not just whole strings.
