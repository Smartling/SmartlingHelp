In the Translation Interface, when you select a translation from the Translation Memory, the field structure of the TM translation may not match the field structure of the string you are translating. &nbsp;

For example, if there is a link in the TM translation but not in the string you are translating, the text matches, but not the structure.

When Smartling detects non-aligned TM selection, Smartling places the entire translation text in the first text field, and displays a yellow alert message. You must cut and paste the text into the correct fields to match the underlying HTML tags.&nbsp;

**Note:**&nbsp;If there is only one field in the string you are translating, you can ignore this messaging.
