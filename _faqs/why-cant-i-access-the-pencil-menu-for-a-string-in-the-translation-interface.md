It's possible for the CSS on a page to prevent access to Smartling's pencil menu.

However, there are other ways to open a string for translation:

1. CTRL + Right Click on any string highlighted yellow.
2. Hold down the ALT key while a string is highlighted will lock the pencil menu in it's visible state until the key is released or another string is highlighted.
