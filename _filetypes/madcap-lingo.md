A MadCap package is a ZIP-archive with one or more XLIFF files, optionally organized in directories. A MadCap archive is treated as a single file. Translated strings in the archive will be associated with the .zip file, not the individual XLIFF files.

Non-XLIFF files in the archive are excluded from processing.

Directory structure and non-XLIFF files are preserved when downloading the translated archive.
