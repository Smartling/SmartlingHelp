Smartling supports .xlf, .xliff, and .xml files that use the XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF)

## Excluding Strings

XLIFF does not support using the `sltrans` directive for marking excluded content. However, for files uploaded [from October 2015 onwards](http://localhost:4000/developers/Misc/Parsers), you can use XLIFFâ€™s `translate` attribute. To exclude a string from translation, set `translate=no`. See the [XLIFF Documentation](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html#translate) for details on the translate attribute.
