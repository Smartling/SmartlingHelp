Back in May, Smartling introduced Linguistic Packages - a way to group up Style Guide, Glossary, Translation Memory, and Leverage and use all of those assets on a set of content.  Linguistic Packages gave us some additional functionality we call cross-locale leverage.

## What is cross-locale leverage?

Cross-locale leverage is the ability to use translations from one language as a translation for another language.  For example, if you translate French for France and you want to use those translations for French in Canada, you can set up cross-locale leverage to automatically populate French (Canada) with French (France) translations.  Using SmartMatch settings, you can control whether the French (Canada) translations are Published automatically or sent to an Edit/Review step for further review and customization.

## Why use cross-locale leverage?

The primary benefit of cross-locale leverage is to be able to translate into a variant of a language without having to complete an entire translation workflow.  This speeds up time-to-market and reduces cost for launching a new language.

Common Cross Locale Configurations

Cross Locale Leveraging and be setup for any variant of a language.  For example:

* French (France) -&gt; French (Canada)
* German (Germany) -&gt; German (Austria)
* Portuguese (Brazil) -&gt; Portuguese (Portugal)
* Spanish (Latin America) -&gt; Spanish (Mexico)
