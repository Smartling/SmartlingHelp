Smartling’s Zendesk Connector lets you use Smartling’s Global Fluency Platform to translate your content. The Zendesk Connector allows you to translate Articles, Sections, Categories from your Help Center, and Dynamic Content for your support tickets. Once the Connector is set up, you can download your original content from Zendesk for translation in Smartling. Translated content is automatically exported to the correct language in your Help Center, or translations at any stage can be exported manually. Images can be localized and internal links, such as to other articles in your Help Center, are automatically adjusted to point to the correct language.

For Help Center items, the Zendesk Connector also creates context for translators.

**Note:** To take advantage of the Connector, you must be able to utilize Zendesk’s localization features - currently restricted to ‘Plus’ and ‘Enterprise’ accounts.
