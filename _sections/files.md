Smartling gives you several options for uploading your resource files for translation and downloading your translated files so you can choose the one that best suits the needs of your project.

**1)** [Upload your resource files](){: .cc-active} and [download translated files](){: .cc-active} directly from the Smartling dashboard.

**2)** If you are using a Github or Beanstalk repository to manage your code, you can set up Smartling's [Repository Connector](){: .cc-active} to automatically upload your files to Smartling when you make a new commit and push translated files back to your repository.

**3)** Use Smartling's [shellÂ scripts](){: .cc-active} or [SDKs](){: .cc-active} to access Smartling's API.

**4)** Manage your files with [direct API requests](){: .cc-active}.
