When you upload a file, Smartling parses it's content into translatable 'strings.' This section covers:

* What happens if there are more than one string with the same text in files uploaded to a project. String uniqueness is affected by [variant metadata](/knowledge-base/articles/unique-strings-and-variants/) within a file, and by [namespaces](/knowledge-base/articles/string-sharing-namespaces/) across multiple files.

* How to handle [placeholders](/knowledge-base/articles/exclude-dynamic-content-using-placeholder-code/) in strings with variables.

* How to instruct Smartling about how to parse your files, using either [inline directives or the File API](/knowledge-base/articles/file-integration-and-the-smartling-api/).

* How file parsing has changed with the implementation of our [newest parser](/knowledge-base/articles/file-parser-version-3-13-october-2015/).
