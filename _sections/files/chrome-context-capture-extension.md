The Chrome Context Capture Extension is an add-on for the Chrome browser that captures dynamic HTML context for a web application as you browse. Any content you can display in a browser can be contextualised this way.

You can also use browser automation software such as Selenium to automate context capture, or simply provide your sitemap and have the extension crawl your site.
