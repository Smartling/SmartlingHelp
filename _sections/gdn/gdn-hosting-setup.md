Before you can begin capturing, translating and serving content through the GDN, you will need to set up some infrastructure to allow Smartling to handle incoming requests for your translated content.

There are many different ways to set up your GDN site, ranging from simple to complex. Work with your Smartling Success Manager to find the best solution for your needs.
