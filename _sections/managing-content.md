* Set up custom&nbsp;[translation workflows](/support/sections/workflows/) for different types of content.
* Manage your content string-by-string from our powerful [List View](/support/sections/the-list-view/).
* Create [Linguistic Assets](/support/sections/linguistic-assets/), such as [Glossaries](/support/sections/glossaries/) and [Style Guides](/support/articles/style-guides/), to help your translators work quickly and accurately.
* [Leverage](/support/articles/leverage-configuration/) translations you've already done to save time and money.
* [Find](/support/articles/global-search/) the content you need, whenever you need it.
* Communicate with your translation team using [Issues](/support/articles/issues/).
* Create packages of translation work and predict your translation costs.
