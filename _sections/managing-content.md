The Smartling Dashboard is your home base for managing all of your translation content. This section will teach you to:

* Create and manage [projects](/knowledge-base/sections/projects/) to organize your content.
* Set up customÂ [translation workflows](/knowledge-base/sections/workflows/) for different types of content.
* Manage your content string-by-string from our powerful [List View](/knowledge-base/sections/the-list-view/).
* Create [Linguistic Assets](/knowledge-base/sections/linguistic-assets/), such as [Glossaries](/knowledge-base/sections/glossaries/) and [Style Guides](/knowledge-base/articles/style-guides/), to help your translators work quickly and accurately.
* [Leverage](/knowledge-base/articles/leverage-configuration/) translations you've already done to save time and money.
* [Find](/knowledge-base/articles/global-search/) the content you need, whenever you need it.
* Communicate with your translation team using [Issues](/knowledge-base/articles/issues/).
* Create [packages of translation work](/knowledge-base/articles/jobs/) and predict your translation costs.
