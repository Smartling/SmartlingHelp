Instead of managing your Glossaries, Style Guides and Translation Memories, on a project-by-project basis, Smartling &nbsp;gives you one place to manage all Linguistic Assets for your account. Your Assets are then combined into Linguistic Packages that can be assigned to a Smartling project.

This arrangement gives you a lot of options for managing your Assets, especially over a large number of projects. If all of your content uses a similar set of Assets, you can just create one or two packages and assign them to every project. Any updates you make to an asset in a Linguistic Package, or to the assets that are included in a Linguistic Package, will be reflected in every project where that Package is assigned. Alternatively, if you are translating highly varied content, you have the option to make your Linguistic Assets modular. For example, you can create a glossary just for your legal terminology and make that glossary part of a Linguistic Package that is assigned only to projects that include legal content.
