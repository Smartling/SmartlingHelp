A Glossary  is a unique set of words or phrases that are important to your content.  By adding terms to the glossary you highlight them to translators, no matter where they appear inside larger strings.  For each term you can instruct the translators to:

* Not translate it (e.g. the name of your products or services)
* Translate it in single consistent way for each language

Each glossary term that requires translation should include a definition along with any relevant information, ensuring appropriate and consistent translation throughout your project.

Your glossaries are made available to Translators in the Translation Interface and glossary terms are highlighted to show that information exists for that term.

See our [translation documentation](/knowledge-base/articles/glossary-in-the-translation-interface/) for more details on the Glossary in the Translation Interface.

To help you create a comprehensive glossary, Smartling scans all strings in your project for recurring terms and provides suggestions for terms to add to your Glossary.

Glossaries are assigned to Smartling Projects as part of a Linguistic Package. See [Create and Manage Linguistic Packages](/knowledge-base/articles/create-and-manage-linguistic-packages/) for details.
