A Glossary &nbsp;is a unique set of words or phrases that are important to your content. &nbsp;By adding terms to the glossary you highlight them to translators, no matter where they appear inside larger strings. &nbsp;For each term you can instruct the translators to:

* Not translate it (e.g. the name of your products or services)
* Translate it in single consistent way for each language

Each glossary term that requires translation should have a definition or any information in relation to your company or industry, ensuring appropriate and consistent translation throughout your project.

To help you create a comprehensive glossary, Smartling scans all strings in your project for recurring terms and provides suggestions for terms to add to your Glossary.

Glossaries are assigned to Smartling Projects as part of a Linguistic Package. See [Create and Manage Linguistic Packages](/knowledge-base/articles/create-and-manage-linguistic-packages/) for details.
