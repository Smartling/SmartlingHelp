In Smartling, all strings pass through a Workflow that begins with a Translation step and ends with a Published step, with any number of Revision steps in between. Revision steps might include editing, internal review, external review, etc. You can configure the order in which content moves through steps and which users can complete each step.

A project can support multiple Workflows to handle different languages or different types of content. For example, if some strings in your project contain legal content, you can create a Workflow just for those strings that contains a ‘Legal Review’ step, conducted by a specialist reviewer.
