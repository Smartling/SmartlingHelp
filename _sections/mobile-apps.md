Mobile apps can require a little extra care when it comes to translation, since screen real-estate is at such a high premium. In a desktop environment, elements can often stretch to accommodate a little more or a little less text, but on mobile, controlling the length of your translations can be crucial. Keeping localized apps up to date can also be challenging, as, unlike a website, the content is often stored directly on the users device and the process of releasing an update through the Android and iOS app stores can be slow.

Smartling provides a few special tools for Mobile apps to help deal with these problems. The [Mobile Delivery Network (MDN)](/knowledge-base/articles/mobile-delivery-network/) allows you to make over-the-air updates to translations in your app without releasing a new version. Our in-app review SDKs for [iOS](/knowledge-base/articles/in-app-review-of-your-ios-app/) and [Android](/knowledge-base/articles/in-app-review-of-your-android-app/) lets you review translations on an actual mobile device or simulator, to make sure your translations fit the required space and work with your touch interface.

Context is especially important for Mobile Apps. The quickest way to contextualize mobile strings is by [uploading screenshots](/knowledge-base/articles/adding-image-context-for-mobile-and-desktop-application-files/). Smartling uses Optical Character Recognition to automatically match the screenshots with strings in your project. For large or ongoing projects this whole process can be automated via our [Image Context API](/developers/api/v2/context/).

Coming soon is an integrated solution for screenshots &nbsp;as part of our SDKs that work in your app to provide "perfect" high quality context that matches the exact strings without reliance on OCR.
