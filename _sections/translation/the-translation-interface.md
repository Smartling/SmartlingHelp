The Translation Interface (TI) is where the work of translation happens. From the TI, translators and editors can:

* Add and edit translations for a string
* Access the Glossary and Style Guide
* Raise issues
* View context for a string, if available
* See the complete translation history for the string.

If you're new to translating with Smartling, check our [Getting Started with Translation](/knowledge-base/articles/getting-started-with-translation/) video for a look at the TI in action.
