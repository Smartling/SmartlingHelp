Temporarily uploads a file, then returns a translated version for requested locales.

This call can be used instead of a standard upload/download if you keep different versions of a file in multiple branches or are triggering rebuilds, and donâ€™t want your files in Smartling to be overwritten by out-of-date versions of a file.

To use the call, you upload a file and identify the Smartling URI where the main version of that file is saved. Smartling will match strings shared between the uploaded file and the main file and return any available translations.
