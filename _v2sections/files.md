Smartling's File API allows you to upload and retrieve files, display a list of recently uploaded files, and check the status of a translationâ€™s progress.

Multiple READ operations can run simultaneously on a single file, but only one WRITE operation can run at a time. Attempting any other operation on a file while a WRITE operation is running will result in an error.

Concurrent API requests are limited to 20 per file and 50 per project. Exceeding this limit will result in a MAX_OPERATIONS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED error.
