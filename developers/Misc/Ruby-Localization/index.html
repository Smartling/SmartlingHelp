<h2>Locale Codes</h2>
<p>YAML resources files for Ruby often begin with a language code. For example:</p>
<pre><code>en:
  string1: 'Hello'
  string2: 'Goodbye'
</code></pre>
<p>When these strings are translated by Smartling, they will be returned with the appropriate language code. For example, the French file will be:</p>
<pre><code>fr:
  string1: 'Bonjour'
  string2: 'Au Revoir'
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to return the full <a href="/developers/Misc/Language-Identifiers/">Smartling Locale Code</a> in your translated files, alter your source file to match your full source locale code. For example.</p>
<pre><code>en-US:
  string1: 'Hello'
  string2: 'Goodbye'
</code></pre>
<p>translated into French(France), will return:</p>
<pre><code>fr-FR:
  string1: 'Hello'
  string2: 'Goodbye'
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish, locale substitution can be turned off completely using a <a href="/developers/supported-file-types/YAML/#yaml_yaml_locale_substitution">file directive</a>. This may be desirable if the first key in your yaml file happens to match a language code unintentionally.</p>

<h2>Plurals</h2>
<p>
Smartling’s translation interface supports plurals according to the    <a href="http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules" rel="nofollow">CLDR pluralization rules</a>, which define which plural forms are used in
    each locale.
</p>
<p>
    Out of the box, Ruby on Rails applications support only the standard English plural forms of One and Other. Translating a YAML file into languages with
    different plural rules, such as Japanese (‘Other’ only) or Czech (One/Few/Many/Other) may cause errors in your Rails application.
</p>
<p>
    To properly localize into multiple languages supporting different plural forms, you must setup your application to use the I18n pluralization backend and
    define pluralization rules in your application for each locale.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>To require pluralization backend:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>

    Create config/initializers/pluralization.rb in your application:
<pre><code class="nohighlight">I18n::Backend::Simple.send<br/>:include<br/>, I18n::Backend::Pluralization)</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
    Create a rule in plurals.rb for each locale in your application. For example, this rule creates four plural forms for Russian: One, Few, Many and Other.

        <strong>plurals.rb</strong>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">{
    :ru => { :i18n => { :plural => { :keys => [:one, :few, :many, :other], :rule => lambda { |n| n % 10 == 1 &amp;&amp; n % 100 != 11 ? :one : [2, 3, 4].include?(n % 10) &amp;&amp; ![12, 13, 14].include?(n % 100) ? :few : n % 10 == 0 || [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].include?(n % 10) || [11, 12, 13, 14].include?(n % 100) ? :many : :other } } } }
    }</code></pre>

    </li>

 </ol>

<p>
Pluralization rules for most locales are    <a href="https://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n/blob/master/test/test_data/locales/plurals.rb" rel="nofollow">publicly available on Github</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    You may need to edit the locale labels to match the labels used in your application.
