                <p>Welcome to our Developer Documentation.</p>

                <p>This section contains information for developers on integrating the power of the Smartling platform into your project. The more effort you put into integration and automation, the less time you have to spend administering translation work.</p>

                <h2>API</h2>

                <p>Smartling's API is extensive and still growing. Almost any action you can take inside the Smartling Dashboard can also be done via API, and if it can't yet, we're probably working on it. Watch this space for updates as we release new endpoints.</p>

                <p>This documentation covers Smartling API version 2. Version 1 is set to be deprecated on March 2017 and should be avoided in new integrations. See our <a href="https://docs.smartling.com/">previous documentation site</a> for API v1.</p>

                <h2>Files</h2>

                <p>
                    If your project uses translatable resource files, you can customize how Smartling parses your file into translatable strings. The File Integration section contains information on all file types supported by Smartling, directives you can add to files to change how they are parsed, and advice for working with common frameworks.
                </p>

                <div class="info">This section concerns technical integration only. For business rules, and general information on managing translations in Smartling, see our <a href="/knowledge-base">Support documentation</a>. </div>
